2. **Commit Changes**: Commit the changes with a descriptive message.

#### Merging Back to Main Branch

1. **Open Pull Request**: Navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab and click "New pull request."
2. **Compare Branches**: Select the base branch (e.g., main) and the compare branch (your feature branch).
3. **Review and Merge**: Review the changes, discuss with team members, and click "Merge pull request" when ready.

## Pull Requests and Code Reviews

### What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.

A pull request is a feature in GitHub that allows developers to propose changes to the codebase. It facilitates code reviews and collaboration by providing a platform for discussing changes before they are merged into the main branch.

#### Steps to Create a Pull Request

1. **Open Pull Request**: In the repository, navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab and click "New pull request."
2. **Select Branches**: Choose the base branch (e.g., main) and the compare branch (your feature branch).
3. **Add Details**: Enter a title and description for the pull request, explaining the changes.
4. **Create Pull Request**: Click "Create pull request."

#### Reviewing a Pull Request

1. **View Changes**: Review the proposed changes, looking at the diffs and overall impact.
2. **Comment and Discuss**: Leave comments, ask questions, and discuss with the author and other team members.
3. **Approve or Request Changes**: Approve the pull request or request changes.
4. **Merge**: Once approved, click "Merge pull request" to integrate the changes into the base branch.

## GitHub Actions

### Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD service that allows developers to automate workflows directly within their GitHub repositories. Workflows are defined using YAML syntax and can be triggered by various events, such as pushes, pull requests, or scheduled times.

#### Example CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Create Workflow File**: Add a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to the repository.
2. **Define Workflow**:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

This workflow runs on every push or pull request to the main branch, checking out the code, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies, and running tests.
